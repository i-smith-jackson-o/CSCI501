Write two short programs that inplement the recursive Quicksort and Merge Sort algorithms. 
Each of these programs will read up to 1000 integers, sort them, and then print them 
in a formatted fashion. 

Input: 
Each program must read from stdin using input redirection
Must properly handle cases where there are zero or more lines of text, 
each containing zero or more integers numbers separated by whitespace. 
Assume test data will only contain valid integer values. 

Output: 
8 sorted numbers per line, right aligned in columns. Use setw to pad numbers with 
leading spaces. Do not print a space after the last number on the line and the 
newline characters. Do not print blank lines. 

Hints: 
Start by working on one of the files, making sure you can read and 
print the unsorted input, then implement the sorting algorithm.
